I’m a software developer focused on building reliable, scalable applications and APIs. I enjoy solving complex problems, writing clean code, and continuously learning new technologies to create impactful software.

I’m especially passionate about fintech and currently building Nest, a minimalist investment insights platform designed to help long-term investors grow their wealth with clarity and confidence.
