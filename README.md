I’m a software developer focused on building reliable, scalable applications and APIs, with an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and thoughtful system design.

I’m especially passionate about fintech and currently building Nest, a modern financial hub for investing, banking, and financial learning. It is built to help people see their entire financial life in one place.
